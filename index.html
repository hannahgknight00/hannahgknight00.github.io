							<h3 class=exp> How does the electric refrigerator work? </h3>
							<hr/>
							<p class=exp> Fridges have 5 basic components that work together to cool food- the compressor, condenser coils, compressor coils, an expansion valve, and a refrigerant.  <br/>
							The refrigerant first is pumped as hot gas into the compressor by the evaporator coils. The refrigerant is condensed into a liquid by the compressor, and its temperature increases. <br/>
							The refrigerant is pumped out of the compressor and into the compressor coils, where it dispels heat. <br/>
							The liquified refrigerant then passes through the expansion valve into the condenser coils, where it evaporates and becomes very cold. It begins to absorb heat from within the refrigerator, and when it has been pumped through and gathered sufficient heat, it is pumped back into the compressor for the cycle to repeat. </p>

						<h3> The Chassis </h3>

						<p> The chassis of the refrigerator protects and holds in place all of the components. It was what we first had to remove, in order to look at the other parts of the refrigerator. </p>

						<h3> Freezer Coils and Fans </h3>
						<hr/>
						<p> When we removed the chassis and reached the Freezer coils, we were surprised to see that they consisted of most of the coils in the fridge, which is unlike what we learned before. I first had to remove the vents, and after that I had to rip the back wall off of the freezer. We then reached the coils. The freezer coils and fans work as follows- do note that the freezer coils would be merely one part of the network of condenser coils and will be referred to as such [condenser coils]. As you may recall, the liquified high-pressure refrigerant is pushed through expansion valves into the condenser coils, and immediately one would feel a cold effect from the condenser coils- this is due to its eagerness to absorb heat in the sudden loss of pressure. The fan is situated in such a place that as cold refrigerant passes through and absorbs heat, the now cool air can be spread throughout the inner chassis. </p>

						<h3> The Icemaker </h3>
						<hr/>
						<p> Retrieving and taking apart the icemaker was easy. I first took out four screws holding the icemaker into the freezer and took it out. I then began the process of taking it apart by unscrewing some screws on the outside and beginning to individually dissect each piece. Many of the pieces were hard to work with because of their small features. The freezer works as follows: in the first step of the cycle, a timed switch sends a current down into a solenoid water valve, which consists of a solenoid electromagnet blocking water flow. When the current reaches the solenoid, the valve opens. Water flows through and fills an ice mold, which begins to freeze. A thermostat placed in the ice mold then detects when the ice is sufficiently cold, and closes a switch in the electrical circuit. This causes a current to flow through a heating coil under the ice mold, loosening the ice from the mold. The electrical circuit then activates a motor, which spins a series of gears with the last gear attached to a long plastic shaft with ejector blades and a plastic cam. The ejector blades revolve and scoop ice cubes out of the mold, pushing them to the front of the  icemaker, through plastic notches, and into a  collection bin. The plastic cam, meanwhile, catches and lifts the shut-off arm. When the ice cubes finish ejecting, it lowers the shut-off arm and repeats the cycle. If the plastic cam cannot reach its lowest position, the cycle does not repeat, preventing an ice overflow. </p>

						<h3> Temperature Control </h3>
						<hr/>
						<p> We then reached the Temperature Control. When taking it out, there was only two screws holding it in from the back. After I removed the screws, I pushed to release it from the notches and disconnected several wires. How it works is that the temperature control is first supported by a thermometer, which measures how much heat is present. If a high enough level of heat is present, the refrigerant cycle continues, and the cold refrigerant removes heat. As the thermometer detects when the refrigerator is too hot or too cold, it is hence able to accurately maintain the requested temperature. It uses this detection by controlling the flow of electricity to the compressor- it is best described as the brain of the refrigerator. When a desired temperature is detected, the thermostat stops the flow of electricity to the compressor. The thermostat controls the electricity through a capillary tube filled with gas. When the temperature of the fridge increases, the gas expans and pushes on a diaphragm, which operates a set of contacts which in turn operate the compressor. </p>

						<h3> Insulation </h3>
						<hr/>
						<p> We found the insulation when we chipped away at the chassis and various other parts. The insulation is a dense nonconducting material that ensures that the refrigerator and its contents remain cold. Because the insulators do not conduct heat or cold, it is able to maintain the internal temperature. This refrigerator's insulation appeared to be made of foam. </p>

						<h3> Conclusion </h3>
						<hr/>
						<p> Refrigerators are very interesting machines and very commonplace. I am happy to say I think we adequately delved into an understanding of refrigerators. To briefly review refrigerators, I would describe them as a thought-out usage of Gay-Lussac's law and basic knowledge of scientific laws such as the water cycle. By pressurizing the refrigerant in such a way that it can cool items put inside the refrigerator and later safely release the heat, we have recently experienced revolutionary changes in the way that food and its respective marketing operates. Refrigerators, in some sense, changed the world. </p>
